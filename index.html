        <p>
            Bonjour tout le monde! My full name is Aroldo Reyes, but I go by Aro. I am a newcomer to the city of Austin, TX by way of New York City, NY.
            I was born and raised in Dallas, TX so I'm excited to be back in my home state. Since moving to Austin I have decided to switch career paths.
            I worked the last 10 years in retail sales in various roles, but I've always had a strong interest in coding and web development. I hope to one day create and/or improve apps and websites
            linked to the world of sports and sneaker/fashion as in there land my strongest passions and interests. 
            In addition to coding languages I want to learn more spoken languages. I'm evidently an English and Spanish speaker and I know some French.
            My life goal is know a total of <b>FIVE</b> languages! First things first, I'm looking forward to making the most of this class and achieve great things that'll facilitate my other goals.

        </p>
